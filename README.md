**Objective:**
This assignment aims to enhance practical skills in using DAX within Power BI to create measures and calculated columns using CALCULATE (), ALL (), ALLEXCEPT () DAX functions. 
You will work with sales dataset containing data on clothing and accessories.

**Tasks:**
1.Matrix Visualization: Construct a matrix to display the percentage contribution of each category to the total sales.
This will provide insights into each category's relative performance within overall sales. (total sales = SUM(sale_amount)).
The total_sales column values shouldnâ€™t change when a filter like category or brand is applied.


2.Card Visualization: Create a card visual to showcase sales by category.
Configure this to respond only to category-specific filters applied to the sales table, ensuring it remains unaffected by other types of filters.
